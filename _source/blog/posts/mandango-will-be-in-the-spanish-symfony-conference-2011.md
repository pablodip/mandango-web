title: Mandango will be in the Spanish Symfony conference 2011
---
I am really excited to announce I will be talking about Mandango in the
[Spanish Symfony conference](http://desymfony.com/. I spoke about MongoDB
and Symfony last year and I'm looking forward to coming back this year,
which is really promising with great talks and people like
[√Ålvaro Videla](https://twitter.com/#!/old_sound) coming from Switzerland
or [Pablo Godel](https://twitter.com/#!/pgodel) from Miami.

I will be talking about [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and why it can
replace most of the times to the traditional databases with big advantages,
and about [Mandango](http://mandango.org/) and why it can help
your applications and developments are faster, of course with
[Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) integration through the MandangoBundle.

So I hope to see you there! :)
