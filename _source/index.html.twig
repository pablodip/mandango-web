    <h2>What is Mandango?</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Mandango</strong> is a simple, poweful and ultrafast <em>Object Document Mapper</em> (<strong>ODM</strong>) for <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>

    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>MongoDB</strong> (Mongo) is a scalable, high-performance, open source, document-oriented <strong>database</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mongo (and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NOSQL</a> movement in general) answer to the <strong>needs for performance</strong> of databases, that each time more applications (especially web) have, due to the high number of reads, writes and the high amount of information to store.
    </p>

    <h2>What is an ODM?</h2>

    <p>
        An <strong>ODM</strong> is a tool that <strong>maps the structure</strong> of the databases <strong>in objects</strong> (PHP in this case). This way you can work in your documents from the database with PHP objects, with all the great advantages that it carries.
    </p>

    <p>
        An ODM also <strong>abstracts</strong> usual operations with the documents, and provides with utilities that can simplify a lot common tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
        An ODM also has a disadvantage: <strong>the performance</strong>. This is due to using objects and abstracting operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Why an ODM with MongoDB?</h2>

    <p>
        Apparently the Mongo philosophy doesn't agree with the philosophy of ODM, because on one hand Mongo speeds the database and on the other hand the ODM slow down the applications. It's true, but we don't have to forget of the <strong>rapid application development</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <em>Rapid Application Development</em> (<strong>RAD</strong>) is <strong>very important</strong> in order that your applications are running <strong>as soon as it is possible</strong>, because it isn't worthwhile to spend a lot of time finishing a superfast application if when it is going to be in production it can't compete or it's unmaintainable.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Mandango?</h2>

    <p>
        Mandango is to the ODM what Mongo is to databases
