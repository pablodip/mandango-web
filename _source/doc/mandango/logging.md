With Mandango you can log the queries that are sent to Mongo to improve the development.

To do it you just have to pass a *PHP callable* to the mandango when you create it:

    [php]
    use Mandango\Mandango;

    $logger = function(array $log) {
        print_r($log);
    }
    $mandango = new Mandango($metadata, $queryCache, $logger);

> [note]
> This functionality doesn't have **any penalty in performance** in production,
> since when it's used it's done with Mongo collection objects
> special for logging, but when it's not used (in production) it's used the
> native ones instead.
