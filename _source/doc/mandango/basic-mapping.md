title: Basic Mapping
---

The mapping is done with the config classes.

Connection
----------

You can define explicitly the connection in the documents. Otherwise the
default connection of the mandango will be used:

    [php]
    array(
        'Model\Article' => array(
            // defining explicitly the connection
            'connection' => 'global',
        ),
        'Model\Author' => array(
            // another explicitly connection
            'connection' => 'local',
        ),
        'Model\Category' => array(
            // nothing, default connection
        ),
    );

> [note]
> To specify the connections it is used the connection names that
> are assigned to the Mandango.

Collection
----------

You can also define explicitly the collection where the documents are saved in,
and if you don't, the [CamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) name
of the documents class will be used for that:

    [php]
    array(
        'Model\Article' => array(
            // defining explicitly the connection
            'collection' => 'articles',
            'fields' => array(
                'title' => 'string',
            ),
        ),
    );

Types
-----

Mandango has types to allow map data between PHP and Mongo.

* **bin_data**
* **boolean**
* **date**
* **float**
* **integer**
* **raw**
* **serialized**
* **string**

You can also define custom types. We'll see how later.

Fields
------

The fields are the data of the documents, the same as in Mongo.

To define the fields you have to indicate the type:

    [php]
    array(
        'Model\Article' => array(
            'fields' => array(
                // as string
                'title' => 'string',
                // as array
                'content' => array('type' => 'string'),
            ),
        ),
    );

You can define also options in the fields.

### Default Value

If you want you can use default values:

    [php]
    array(
        'Model\Article' => array(
            'fields' => array(
                'is_active' => array('type' => 'boolean', 'default' => true),
            ),
        ),
    );

### Database Field

You can change the field in which the data is saved in the database. Thus you
can use a different field name in PHP and Mongo:

    [php]
    array(
        'Model\Article' => array(
            'fields' => array(
                'php_field_name' => array('type' => 'string', 'db_name' => 'mongo_field_name'),
            ),
        ),
    );

These are the options the Mandango's Core extension accepts, but you can use
more options depending on the extensions you use.
